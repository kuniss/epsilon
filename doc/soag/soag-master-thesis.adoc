== Introduction

Compilers basically realize complex partial functions: they map elements of a well-defined subset of all buildable strings into other strings; the definition and value domain of a compiler understood as a function are formal languages. The implementation of a compiler results is in principle the result of the comparison of sentences of the source language and the sentences of the target
target language. The number of sentences in a formal language is however potentially infinite, a Compilerof this form would therefore not be recordable. Now the sentences of many languages can be structured in such a way that
a finite structure of all sentences of a language can be derived. These structures, called grammars could now, since they are finite, be used constructively for the comparison in a compiler.

Unfortunately this comparison is not comprehensible in "handwritten" compilers. Thus however
the actual function of a compiler is not transparent. Also the best and most exact manual of a
compiler does not describe its function completely. The only complete description of the
functionality of a compiler is its coding. But who wants to be expected to read the source code of a compiler for verification, especially the actual translation structure of programming styles, inadequacies of the used programming language or optimizations, if the source code is at all available.
Source code at all is available. Desirably a formalism would be, in which structures of the source and target language in a simple, clear form to be contrasted and from which automatically
a compiler can be generated.

The _attribute grammars_ (AGs) introduced by Knuth provide a formalism that can be used not only to describe not only for the description of programming languages, but also as basis for the automatic generation of compilers. This formalism requires as open calculus however the use of a further specification or programming language for the description of the context conditions and the context conditions and the semantics of a language. This complicates the understanding of the compiler and obscures its actual functionality, as in the "handwritten" compiler.

The _extended affix grammars_ (EAGs) introduced by Watt represent a closed calculus and compensate for this disadvantage <<Watt>>. Syntax and semantics of a programming language are described in a formalism, which omits all non-relevant information - concerning the optimization, the used Implementation language used and other - concerning - renounces. The comparison of the source and target language is explicit and describes the transformation function to be realized by the compiler to be realized by the compiler unambiguously and in simple form. In 1984 a compiler generator called Eta was developed by Schröer at the Department of Computer Science of the TU Berlin based on the Extended Affix Grammars <<Schröer>>. advantages of this concept for the automatic generation of translators and has been used since then with many has since been used with many extensions also in the context of courses. One of these extensions transfers the principle of ordered attribute grammars (OAGen, [Kastens]) into the world of extended Affix  Grammars and was integrated into the compiler generator Eta by Kutza in 1989 [Kutza]. The OAGen are a polynomial subclass of the multi-visit AGs introduced by Engelfriet [Engelfriet]. For multi-visit AGs a runtime and size efficient evaluator can be given, unfortunately the decision whether a multi-visit AG exists is NP-complete.

OAGs are computed via the polynomial computability of a total order over the attribute of each grammar symbol X, such that in every possible attributed derivation tree the attribute instances of an instance of X can always be evaluated according to this order, are defined. However, there are always practical AGs occur for which such a total order of attributes cannot be computed. Kastens gives different possibilities to be able to order the attributes of an AG after all <<KaHuZi>>, which however leave many problematic AGs unnoticed. Kröplin and Kannapinn have in their work a generalization of one of these ideas <<KröpKann>>. The AGs they specify are _sequentially orientable_ AGs (SOAGs) are a subclass of mult-visit AGs, and the decision,  whether an AG is an SOAG is also NP-complete. The authors present a procedure to identify the AG "responsible" for the NP-completeness "responsible" nondeterminism with an ad hoc determinism, whereby an attribute evaluation order can be computed for all OAGs and many non-OAGs.

The task of the present diploma thesis was to transfer the principle of SOAGs to the Extended grammars and to implement an evaluator generator for the outlined procedure. implemented. The starting point for this is the compiler generator _Epsilon_, which was developed at the TU Berlin under the guidance of Kröplin and Kannapinn in the context of the diploma thesis of Demuth and Weber.

<<DeWe>>. It replaces the predecessor system Eta, which was "outdated" in its conception and could not be further maintained with the extremely low system _Eta_ and, in particular, provides a parser generator with scanner.

The paper describes the implementation of the principle of SOAGs in the concept of Extended Affix Grammars and closely follows it. In order to underline this concern and to clarify the complexity of the implementation, the source texts are commented.implementation, the source texts are commented and reprinted in the original. Thus the description of abstract algorithms is omitted. This work can describe the underlying theory only rudimentarily in terms of the implementation. in the sense of the implementation, for a comprehensive treatment must be referred to appropriate sources <<KröpKann>>. must be referred to <<KröpKann>>.

The following documentation starts with a general overview of the implementation and the auxiliary modules used.

Chapter 7 undertakes an effort analysis of the presented algorithms, and in the last chapter the actual code generation is treated.

The appendix contains a reduced example with the module generated by the evaluator generator, as well as an analysis of two non-OEAGs that are recognized as SOEAGs by the generator.

==  General information about the implementation

Based on the existing compiler generator Epsilon the programming was done with the programming language Oberon <<ReiWi>> in the operating system of the same name. In order to have a uniform working and test environment, Oberon was likewise selected as target language of the generation. The compiler generator Epsilon contains the two basic modules _IO_ and _eSets_, which are also used in this system extension. system extension. A description of these two modules can be found in <<DeWe>>. The programming techniques suggested there of the grouping of program objects of a type in a field is further used. Data type extensions are made by creating a parallel field. To
each field `_F_` there is a constant `_firstF_`, which symbolizes the first usable index of the field, and a variable `_NextF_`, which points to the first empty field entry. The fields are expanded by module-local procedures named `Expand`. Undefined references to these fields are represented by the constant `nil`.

=== Lists and Stacks

The `eAList` module implements lists as dynamically expandable fields and implements the following
Interface:Lists and Stacks
The module eAList implements lists as dynamically extendable fields and realizes the following interface:

----
DEFINITION eALists;
    CONST
        firstIndex = 0;
    TYPE
        AList = POINTER TO AListDesc;
        AListDesc = RECORD
            Last: INTEGER;
            Elem: OpenList;
        END;

    PROCEDURE Append (VAR List: AList; Value: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Delete (VAR List: AList; Index: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE IndexOf (VAR List: AList; Value: INTEGER): INTEGER;
    PROCEDURE New (VAR List: AList; Len: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Reset (VAR List: AList);
END eALists.
----

The procedures `New` and `Reset` create a new list and empty it respectively. The procedure `Append` adds an element to the the end of the list. The `Delete`  procedure deletes an element from the list by overwriting the position of the element to be deleted with the last element of the list. overwriting the position of the element to be deleted with the last element of the list and shortening the list by one element. element from the list. Thus, the action is of constant effort, but changes the sequence  within the list. The `IndexOf` function returns the list index of an element. The element is determined by linear search.

Furthermore, an `eStacks` module was implemented to describe basement storage. This module is based on the previous module and implements the known basement storage procedures:

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 8

----
DEFINITION eStacks;
    
    IMPORT eALists;

    TYPE
        Stack = POINTER TO RECORD (eALists.AListDesc) END;

    PROCEDURE IsEmpty (S: Stack): BOOLEAN;
    PROCEDURE New (VAR S: Stack; Len: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Pop (VAR S: Stack; VAR Val: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Push (VAR S: Stack; Val: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Reset (VAR S: Stack);
    PROCEDURE Top (VAR S: Stack; VAR Val: INTEGER);

END eStacks.
----

=== Different implementations of sets

The base module `eSets` proved to be unsuitable in effort-critical sections of the implementation. In particular, the elements contained in a set could not be accessed efficiently as a list.  the bit vector representing the set, even for sparse sets, would have had to be traversed completely. would have had to be traversed completely. It is obvious to extend the data structure of the base module by a list of the elements contained in the set. contained in the set. This allows efficient access and increases the memory requirement only slightly for sparse sets. only insignificantly for sparse sets. This approach was realized in the module `eBSets` with the following interface:

----
DEFINITION eBSets;

    IMPORT eALists;

    CONST
        firstIndex = 0;

    TYPE
        BSet = POINTER TO BSetDesc;
        BSetDesc = RECORD
            Max: INTEGER;
            List: eALists.AList;
        END;

    PROCEDURE Delete (VAR S: BSet; Elem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE In (S: BSet; Elem: INTEGER): BOOLEAN;
    PROCEDURE Insert (VAR S: BSet; Elem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE New (VAR S: BSet; MaxElem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Reset (VAR S: BSet);

END eBSets.
----

The `BSetDesc` data structure contains a bit vector that is not visible in the interface and is declared as follows. declared as follows:
    
----  
    BitVector: eSets.OpenSet;
----

The procedure `New` creates a set of constant size. `Reset` deletes the content of a set, the allocated data structure is preserved and can be reused. The function `In` checks whether an element is contained in the set. set is contained. The list of elements contained in the set S can be effectively accessed by constructs of the type S.List<<eBSets.firstIndex>> to S.List<<S.List.Las>>]. The procedures Insert and Delete add an element to the set and delete it from the set, respectively. The deletion of an element is of linear effort in this implementation, because the list of the contained elements must be searched for it. 

The linear overhead for deleting an element can unnecessarily increase the overhead of an algorithm by a power of by a power. Therefore, quantities have been implemented in the `eASets` module that allow the deletion of a 

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 9

element in constant time and for which the list of elements contained in a set can be retrieved efficiently. can be retrieved. The interface is similar to the previous module:

DEFINITION eASets;
    IMPORT eALists;
        
    CONST
        firstIndex = 0;
    
    TYPE
        ASet = POINTER TO ASetDesc;
        ASetDesc = RECORD
            Max: INTEGER;
            List: eALists.AList;
        END;

    PROCEDURE Delete (VAR S: ASet; Elem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE In (S: ASet; Elem: INTEGER): BOOLEAN;
    PROCEDURE Insert (VAR S: ASet; Elem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE IsEmpty (VAR S: ASet): BOOLEAN;
    PROCEDURE New (VAR S: ASet; MaxElem: INTEGER);
    PROCEDURE Reset (VAR S: ASet);
    PROCEDURE Test;
END eASets.

The only addition is the `IsEmpty` function, which indicates whether a set is empty. In contrast to `eBSets` the bit vector was omitted completely. The elements are entered into the list `ASet.List` in the order of their insertion into the set. the set into the list `ASet.List`, where `ASet.List.Last` refers to the last element entered. element. The list is implemented as a field and results from the field entries of `ASets.List<<eASets.firstIndex>>` to `ASets.Lis<<ASet.List.Last>>`. If the value i of an element to be inserted into the set is greater than `ASet.List.Last`, then i is appended to the end of the list and a pointer to the end of the list is entered in the field position `ASet.List<<i>>`. If the value i of the element is less than or equal to `ASet.List.Last`, it is inserted at the position ASet.List[i]. is entered. The element that was previously at its position is moved to the end of the list and its pointer is and its pointer is moved accordingly. This procedure divides the field into two halves. In the  first part lists the elements contained in the set. The second part contains for all set elements whose value is greater than `ASet.List.Last`, a value greater than zero on their field position and otherwise the value noelem. When the contents of the set S are changed by the interface procedures the following invariants are preserved in the `ASet.List field`. For all field indices i less-than-equal to the data element `ASet.List.Last`:
----
    ASet.List[i]=i ⇔ i∈S ∧ ASet.List[i]≠i ⇒ ASet.List[i]∈S
----

and for all field indices `i` that are greater than the data element `ASet.List.Last`:

----
    i∈S ⇔ ASet.List[i]≠noelem ∧ i∉S ⇔ ASet.List[i]=noelem
----

From these invariants it is very easy to derive when an element is contained in a set. This makes the bit vector superfluous. The procedures Insert and Delete can be realized with constant effort.

In summary it can be stated that the module `eASets` is particularly well suited for the implementation of densely populated sets, while the module `eBSets` is more suitable for sparsely populated sets, when no time-critical time-critical deletion of elements is required. Both modules can only  constant sets, dynamic extensions during runtime are not possible.

Both set implementations use the `eAList` module. However, this is a complete
encapsulation - you should not apply the interface procedures of the `eAList` module to the list data module `eAList` on the list data structures of the sets, since this can make the data structure inconsistent. The option of dynamic extensibility of lists is not used in the implementations of the sets.

For all generated compilers additionally the independent module `eLIStacks` was implemented, which manages data elements of the type `LONGINT`.

=== System structure

The SOAG evaluator generator extends the original compiler generator Epsilon by the modules shown in Fig. 3-1. The arrows indicate significant import relationships between the modules. The modules `eALists`, `eStacks`, `eASets`, and `eBSets` are used multiple times to implement Lists, Sets, and Cellar Stores, which can be instantiated in any number. The modules with the "SOAG" prefix describe the actual SOAG evaluator generator. The module `SOAG` contains the central data structures of the generator. In the module `SOAGPartition` the Affixpartition of the analyzed grammar is calculated and thus it is decided whether the generation of an evaluator is possible. In

// doc\soag\images\image-3.1-system-structure.PNG

`SOAGVisitSeq`, the visit sequences for the evaluator are calculated using the `SOAGHash` module, which implements a hash table. Optionally, the `SOAGOptimizer` module provides information to information is provided by the module `SOAGOptimizer`, which allows an optimization of the generated evaluator by storing affix variables in cellar memories and global variables. The module `SOAGGen` generates from the Visit sequences the  The module `SOAGProtocol` serves above all for the logging of central data structure contents during development. central data structure contents during the development.

As in the original compiler generator Epsilon, all modules are prefixed with an "e" to prevent name conflicts with the Oberon system.

== Definition of terms and internalization

This chapter provides a brief formal definition of EAGs to capture the terminology used in the rest of the paper. terminology used in further work. It is closely based on the definitions of Kutza [Kutza]. Since however EAGen in the compiler generator Epsilon are no longer available in normal form, some extensions and new definitions became necessary. The terms _affix parameter_ and _defining affix_ are newly introduced and the data structure for the internal representation of the EAGen is described.

=== Terminology and definition of EAGs

An Extended Affix Grammar is an 8-tuple
----
    	EAG = (MN, MT, MR, HN, HT, SPEC, HR, S)
----
whose individual components are defined as follows:

-_MN_ is a finite set of _meta-non-terminals_. If _M_ ∈ _MN_, then _M_, _M1_, _M2_, ... as well as _#M_, _#M1_, _#M2_, ... _Affixes_ to _M_.
For any affix _A_ to _M_, _dom(A)_ := _M_ is the range of values of the `affix`. In several other sources the term _variable_ is used synonymously to the term `affix`.

-_MT_ represents the finite set of _meta-terminals_ with MN ∩ _MT_ = ∅.

-_MR_ represents the finite set of _meta-rules_ of the form _M~0~_ = _M~1~_.... _M~n~_ with _n0_ and _M~0~_ ∈ _MN_ and _M~i~_ ∈ _MN_ ∪ _MT_).

The context-free grammar _MG~M~_ := (_MN_, _MT_, _MR_, _M_) is called the meta-grammar spanned by the meta-non-terminal _M_ is called the _meta-grammar_ spanned by the meta-non-terminal _M_. _Affix forms_ to a meta-non-terminal M are sentence forms of MG~M~ in which all occurring meta-nonterminals have been replaced by corresponding affixes.

-_HN- is a finite set of _hyper-nonterminals_.

-_HT_ is a finite set of _hyper-terminals_, with _HN_ ∩ -HN_ = ∅.

-_SPEC_ is a finite set of _specifications_ of the form _H_ _( dir(a~1~) dom(a~1~), ..., dir(a~#a(H)~) dom(a~#a(H)~))_,
therein are:

-_#a(H)_ is the ordinality of _H_

-the tuples _ai_ with _0 < i ≤ #a(H)_ affix positions of H, which are also named in the form ai H ai H. The set A(H) = { a~i~^H^ : 0 < i ≤ #a(H)} is the set of all affix positions of the hypernonterminal _H_.

-_dir(a~i~)_ ∈ {↑,↓} is the direction of the affix position _a~i~_. Affix positions with the direction ↓ are  _inherited_, those with the direction ↑ _synthesized_. _I(H)_ and _S(H)_ denote the sets of inherited and derived affixes of the hyper-nonterminal _H_, respectively.

-_dom(a~i~)_ ∈ _MN_ the range of values of an affix position

The specification of an _EAG_ is not explicitly present in the calculus of the compiler generator Epsilon, but is integrated into the syntactic structure of the hyper-rules for simplification. Formally, however, a separation is is unavoidable and also easier to handle. 

If one inserts affix forms of the corresponding value range into the affix positions of a hyper non-terminal, then a _symbol occurrence_ results which is formally defined as follows: 

If _H( dir(a~1~)_ M~1~, ..., _dir(a~#a(H)~) M~#a(H)~_ is a specification and _f~1~, .., f~#a(H)~_ are affix forms to _M~1~, .., M~#a(H)~_, then _H_, parameterised with affix forms _H(f~1~, .., f~#a(H)~)_, is a _symbol occurrence_. In other sources the term _hypernotion_ is also used.

- _HR_ is a finite set of hyper-rules. A hyper-rule _r_ consists of one left and one right rule side and has the form _X~0~ : X~1~ ... X~n~_ with _~n~≥0_, where _X~0~_ is a symbol occurrence and the _X~i~_ are symbol occurrences or hyper-terminals. The colon separates the left-hand rule side from the right. So that the symbol occurrences can be clearly distinguished outside the rule context, they are additionally they are additionally parameterised with the rule: _X^i^~r~_.

Within the generation of an evaluator, the hyper-terminals of a hyper-rule are abstracted.
The expression _#S(r)_ defines the number of symbol occurrences in the rule _r_.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page  18

In the context of a rule, the parameters ai of a symbol occurrence X(a~1~,..,a~#a(H)~) are called _affix parameters_. In order to be able to distinguish affix parameters unambiguously even without the context of the rule, they are with the rule _r_ and the index of the symbol occurrence _X~i~_: _a~k~^(r,i)^_. The position index _k_ refers either to the position of the affix parameter in the list of affix parameters of the symbol occurrence or, if the index of the symbol occurrence is omitted, to the position in the list of all affix parameters of a rule _r_: _a~k~^(r)^_. The expression _#a(r)_ quantifies the number of all affix parameters used in the rule _r_. The term affix parameter has been redefined in this work. In <<ZiVoKüNa>> there is the affix positions of the specification and the parameterisation of the symbol occurrences are not conceptually affix parameters are defined as affix positions of a rule. This would lead to confusion, especially in the description of the implementation, since affix parameters, as can be seen in thedefinition below, some affix parameters have other properties that cannot be applied to affix positions in any way. are in no way transferable to affix positions. Kutza defines the synonymous term of _affix occurrence_ <<Kutza>>, which I do not consider adequate, but for historical reasons it has found its way into the implementation.  for historical reasons. However, since there is a close relationship between affix parameters and affix positions, the following conceptual relation is defined: An affix parameter a~k~^(r,i)^ of a rule _r corresponds_ to an affix position _a~j~^X^_,  if _X~i~^r^_ =_X_ and _k=j_ holds. In this case _X~i~^r^_ is a symbol occurrence for the symbol _X_ in rule _r_, and the  affix parameter _a~k~^(r,i)^_ is on the _j_-th parameter position of the symbol occurrence _X~i~^r^_.

The set of all affix parameters of a rule r is defined by _AP(r)_ := { a~k~^(r,i)^: 0 _<i≤#S(r)_ and 0<k≤_#a(X~i)~}_. An affix parameter a~k~^(r,i)^ is called defining if with _X=X~i~_ holds: (_i_=0 and _dir(a~k~^X^)_= ↓) or (_i_>0 and _dir(a~k~^X^)_=↑), and applicative if with _X=X~i~_ holds: (_i_=0 and _dir(a~k~^X^)_=↑) or (_i_>0 and _dir(a~k~^X^)_= ↓). _AP~D~(r)_ and _AP~A~(r)_ denote the sets of defining and applying affix parameters, respectively. The content of each applying affix parameter (a^(r,i)^) results from its affix form. The affix form, in turn, consists of affixes that result from defining affix parameters of the rule _r_. Thus, (a^(r,i)^) is defined as a function of a set D(a^(r,i)^) of affix parameters of the same rule. The well-formedness conditions ensure that the _EAG_ is in _Bochmann normal form_, i.e. that there are no applying affix parameters are contained in D(a^(r,i)^) are contained. _D_ is interpreted in the usual way as a relation on affix parameters, i.e. 

_(a^(r,i)^), b^(rj)^)_ ∈ _D_ ⇔ _b^(rj)^)_ ∈ _D(a^(r,i)^)_, 

where the dependencies in the direction of data flow are described by 

_D^-1^_ = { _(b^(rj)^, a^(r,i)^)_: _(a^(r,i)^, b^(rj)^)_ ∈ _D_}.

An affix is a _defining affix_ if it is textually placed in a hyper-rule before all other affixes of the same name in an affix form of a defining affix parameter. affixes in an affix form of a defining affix parameter. A hyper-rule is _left-defining_, if for every affix _V_ in applying affix parameters and for every negated affix _#V_ in defining affix parameters, there exists a defining affix _V_.

-_S_ is an excellent hyper-nonterminal, the starting symbol with specification _S(↑M)_, where _M_ ∈ _MN_. 

_EAGs_ allow the formulation of so-called predicates. Predicates are specified by hyper-nonterminals which can be derived empty or fail. It makes sense to split the _EAG_ into a generative and a predicative part, since predicates contribute nothing to the context-free structure of the source language.

The set of _basic non-terminals GN_ of an _EAG_ is inductively defined as follows:

-_S_ is a basic non-terminal;

-if a hyper-rule contains a hyper-terminal on the right-hand side of the rule, then the hyper-non-terminal on the left-hand side of the rule is a basic non-terminal. on the left-hand side of the rule is a basic non-terminal;

-if a hyper-rule on the right-hand side of the rule contains a basic non-terminal, the hyper-non-terminal on the left-hand side of the rule is a basic non-terminal. on the left-hand side of the rule is a basic non-terminal. 
The set _PN_ of _predicate non-terminals_ contains all hyper-non-terminals which are not basic non-terminals. are.

A hyper-rule is a _predicate rule_ if on its left-hand side there is a symbol occurrence of a predicate non-terminal; all other rules are evaluator rules. The basic grammar (also called _parser grammar_) of an _EAG_ is a context-free grammar consisting of the basic non-terminals, the hyper-terminals and the evaluator rules. hyper-terminals and the evaluator rules, in which the predicate non-terminals and all parameterisations have been parameterisations have been eliminated. The start symbol of the _EAG_ remains as the start symbol.

A parser generated from the basic grammar produces derivation trees of the parser grammar, which, however, no longer contain hyper-terminals. no longer contain hyper-terminals. A derivation tree _t_ is an ordered tree. Each node of _t_ is

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 19

is marked with a basic non-terminal. For each node _k_ of the derivation tree _t_ there exists a rule _r=X~0~^r^_ : _X^r^~1~,...,X^r^~#S(r)~_, so that _k- instance of the symbol occurrence _X~0~^r^_ and its sons are instances of the symbol occurrences _X^r^~1~,...,X^r^~#S(r)~_; _k_ is additionally marked with _r_. Furthermore, each node is assigned the instances of the affixes occurring in the hyper-rule - called _affix variables_ - are assigned to each node. of the defining affix and contain the translation of the evaluation. The root of each derivation tree generated by the parser is an instance of the start symbol _S_ of the _EAG_. 

=== Well-formedness conditions for EAGs

An EAG is well-formed if
1. its basic grammar is unambiguous and each basic rule arises from exactly one hyper-rule,
2. every meta-non-terminal _M_ ∈ _MR_ is _strictly synthesised_ or the meta-grammar spanned by _M_ is _MG~M~_ is  unique,
3. the EAG is cycle-free, and
4. all predicate rules are left-defining and the reachable predicates are unique and convergent.

The first condition enables the strict separation of the context-free analysis from the analysis of the context dependencies and thus an independent generation of parsers and evaluators. It is not automatically verifiable, since the problem of the uniqueness of any context-free language is not decidable. decidable.

A meta-nonterminal _M_ ∈ _MR_ is _strictly synthesising_ if, for all defining affix parameters that contain an affix ^_A_ to _M_, _A_ is the only constituent of the affix form and a defining affix, and no defining affix parameter contains the negated affix _#A_. The second condition preserves the uniqueness of all affix form analyses and prevents comparisons for ambiguous meta-grammars for ambiguous derivation trees. The generator cannot check compliance with this condition because, like the first condition, the problem is with the first condition is undecidable.

The cycle-free check of an EAG is an integral part of any evaluator generation procedure and is described in detail in the following chapter.

The fourth condition ensures the availability of all transfer parameters of a predicate call and ensures the termination and the uniform calculation of the return parameters of all predicate calls. termination as well as the uniform calculation of the return parameters of all predicate calls. Without this condition, an unambiguous generation of predicate procedures would not be possible.

The specifics of the generation procedure to be presented here require yet another condition, which is valid for most evaluation procedures with multiple visits of the tree nodes, and therefore should be should be mentioned already now. It is the requirement for the left-definiteness of all hyper-rules, as it has already been demanded for predicate rules. It ensures that every affix in an affix parameter, at least once in a defining affix parameter of the same rule, so that its value at the time of so that its value is known at the time of synthesis. This condition can be check this condition automatically.

=== Internal representation of the EAGs

Since the primary data structure of the compiler generator Epsilon is adapted to the EBNF rules of the specification language [DeWe], the rules for the calculation of an evaluator for SOAGs are in BNF form. <<DeWe>>, but for the computation of an evaluator for SOAGen the rules must be available in BNF form, a corresponding data structure and an algorithm that performs this transformation were developed.  Both are presented in the following.

To calculate the SOAG property of a specification, each alternative of the initial data structure must be converted into an independent rule. The optional alternative and the repetition must be stored in their BNF equivalent form. All these rules are recorded in the `Rule` field. `SymOcc` refers to an area in the `SymOcc` field containing all symbol occurrences of a rule `AffOcc` refers to an area in the `AffOcc` field containing all affix parameters belonging to the rule.

The connection to the output data structure of the EAG module is established by the RECORD field `Rule` in the type extension `EmptyRule` and by the RECORD field `Alt` in the type extension `OrdRule` (_ordinary rule_). These are necessary to enable access to the parameters and text positions of the rules. enable access to the parameters and text positions of the rules. The transformed rules are directly reflected in the data structure to be described. For a pictorial illustration of the data structure, I use the following table (Table 4-1)

Example specification. The unique indexing of the affixes in Table 4-1 serves only to track their positioning after the transformation. _λ_ symbolises the empty word. (r1) and (r2) denote two rules uniquely, and some indices on hyper-nonterminals are used to uniquely distinguish different occurrences of the hyper-non-terminal _A.

== Determination of affix partitions

The theory presented in this chapter for the calculation of affix partitions is essentially based on the work of Kröplin and Kannapin <<KröpKann>>. Only some adaptations to the terminology of the terminology used for the EAGs.

=== Multi-visit EAGs

In this section, multi-visit EAGs are defined using the orientations suggested by Kastens <<Kastens>>. orientations. For later modification, the OEAG method is reconstructed.

A visit of a tree starts and ends at the root _r_ and consists in between of an arbitrary sequence of visits of the subtrees whose roots are sons of _r_. A family of ordered partitions _(A~1~(X),...,A~n(X)~(X))_ for _X_ ∈ _HN_ with n  _(X)_ ≥ _0_ is _visit-correct_ if and only if for each derivation tree _t_ the values of all affix parameter instances in _n(S)_ visits of _t_ can be computed, where at the _i_-th visit of each subtree whose root is marked with _X_, exactly the corresponding instances of the affix parameters _A~i~(X)_ are evaluated. Thus an EAG for which there is such a visit-correct family of partitions, is a _("simple") multi-visit EAG_.

In order to have at least one constructive criterion for deciding whether a given family of partitions is is visit-correct, an equivalent characterisation of multi-visit EAGs is given below. is given. Instead of specifying evaluation orders by total orders on _A(X)_ , the more appropriate concept of orientations is used. more appropriate concept of orientations is used, where an order is determined only between each inherited and each synthesised affix position. An _orientation_ of the symmetric product _A*B_ = _(A×B)_ ∪ _(B×A)_ for sets _A_ and _B_ is a relation _R_ ⊆ _A*B_, where for each _a_ ∈ _A_ and _b_ ∈ _B_. either _(a,b)_ ∈ _R_ or _(b,a)_ ∈ _R_ holds. In the following, a bijection between the _canonical partitions_ _(A~1~(X),...,A~n(X)~(X))_ of _A(X)_ where each _A~i~(X)_ is an inherited affix for _1≤i<n(X)_, and for _1<i≤n(X)_ a synthesised affix position, and the corresponding acyclic orientations of _I(X)_ * _S(X)_.

Definition 5-1_(acyclic orientation)_::
Let (A1(X),...,An(X)(X)) be an ordered partition of A(X) for X ∈ HN. Then +
        DS(X) = {_(a,b)_ ∈ _I(X)_ × _S(X)_: -a_ ∈ _Ai(X)_ and _b_ ∈ _Aj(X)_ for _i≤j} ∪ +
                {_(b,a)_ ∈ _S(X)_ × _I(X)_: _a_ ∈ _Ai(X)_ and _b_ ∈ _Aj(X)_ for _i>j} +
the corresponding (acyclic) orientation of I(X) * S(X).

Definition 5-2(Construction of a partition):
Let DS(X) be an acyclic orientation of I(X) * S(X) for X ∈ HN. To this end, inductively construct the set
B0(X) = ∅,
B1(X) = { a ∈ S(X): there is no (a,b) ∈ DS(X)},
Bi+1(X) = { a: for all (a,b) ∈ DS(X) there is b ∈ Bi(X) }
is defined. Then there is a smallest number n(X) for which B2n(X)(X) = A(X) holds, and with.
Ai(X) = B2(n(X)-i+1)(X) / B2(n(X)-i)(X), (A1(X),...,An(X)(X)) is the associated ordered partition of A(X).
For the construction of the associated partition of A(X), the following always applies
Ai(X) ∩ I(X) = B2(n(X)-i+1)(X) \ B2(n(X)-i)+1(X)
Ai(X) ∩ I(X) = B2(n(X)-i)+1(X) \ B2(n(X)-i)(X), 

even if _DS(X)_ as below is only the transitive hull of a subset of an acyclic orientation _I(X) * S(X)_. In this case, _(A~1~(X),...,A~n(X)~(X))_ is called the _box partition belonging_ to _DS(X)_,  which is characterized by the fact that in a partition as short as possible each affix position is arranged as late as possible ("lazy"). ("lazy") in the shortest possible partition. The corresponding orientation is then called _box completion_. 

It is easy to see that an EAG is a multi-visit EAG exactly if for every _X_ ∈ _HN_ there is an orientation _DS(X)_ of _I(X) * S(X)_ such that the extended dependencies.  

_D^-1^_ ∪ {_(a^(r,i)^, b^(r,i)^)_: _(a,b)_ ∈ _DS(X^r^~i~)_}

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 30

are acyclic. Thus, the decision problem of whether a given EAG is a multi-visit EAG is in NP, and furthermore Engelfriet and Filé have shown for attribute grammars <<EngFil>> that this problem is NP-complete.

However, from the dependencies _D^-1^_, we can efficiently read a necessary condition that every visit-correct family of partitions must satisfy. For this purpose, all direct and resulting indirect dependencies between affix parameters of a symbol occurrence are transferred to all corresponding affix parameters of the same symbol.

Definition 5-3 (_induced dependencies_):

Let _DP_ be a relation on affix parameters. Then the induced dependencies are defined as the smallest relation defined as 
    
_ind(DP)_ = _DP_ ∪ {_(a^(q,j)^, b^(q,j)^)_: _(a^(r,i)^, b ^(r,i)^)_ ∈ _ind(DP)^+^_ for _X^r^~i~ = X^q^~j~_} 

is satisfied, where _R^+^_ denotes the transitive hull of a relation _R_. 

The induced dependences _IDP_ = _ind(D^-1^)_ reflect not only transitive dependences to the derivation trees, but also such arrangements, which result compellingly from the abstraction from the context of the symbols. The projection of _IDP_ onto _A(X)_ is denoted by _IDS(X)_, i.e. 

_IDS(X)_ = {_(a,b)_ :_(a^(r,i)^_, _b^(r,i)^)_ ∈ _IDP_ for _X^r^~i~_ = X}, 

and for any visit-correct family of partitions with associated orientations _DS(X)_, it follows that 

_IDS(X)_ ∩ _(I(X) * S(X))_ ⊆ _DS(X)_. 

Furthermore, for any multi-visit EAG IDP is acyclic. If this is the case, then for any _X_ ∈ _HN_, _IDS(X)_ is the transitive hull of a subset of an acyclic orientation of _I(X) * S(X)_. 

From the given necessary condition, Kastens has determined in <<Kastens>> a subclass of multi-visit AGs for which a visit-correct family of partitions can be computed efficiently, and which is also very easily, as shown by Kutza <<Kutza>>, can be applied to EAGs. An EAG is exactly if _IDP_ is acyclic and the family of box partitions belonging to _IDS(X)_ is visit-correct.

=== Sequentially orientable EAGs

In the following, the OEAG method will now be modified to systematically determine larger subclasses of the multi-visit EAGs.

The weakness of the OEAG method is that the partitions from _IDS(X)_ for _X_ ∈ _HN_ are determined independently of each other. To remedy this, Kastens in <<KaHuZi>> therefore outlined a more "careful" procedure, in which the family of partitions is formed symbol-wise and new induced dependencies are taken into account, which result from already determined partitions. Those multi-visit AGs for which this sequential procedure is successful are called "automatically arranged orderly". This approach of Kastens mainly makes a statement about the order of the symbols in the determination of a partition. This influence of the order will be in the foreground of the following the foreground of the further investigations.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 31

The example of an EAG shown in Figure 5-1 combines in two rules the dependencies of a "leftto-right threading" (a) and a "right-to-left threading" (b). According to Reps and Teitelbaum [RepTei] illustrate multi-visit AGs corresponding to this type of EAGs illustrate a practically relevant constellation in which the OAG procedure, and hence the OEAG procedure, fails. Since there is only one symbol in this case, the sequential method cannot be successful either. At this point the superiority of the c_oncept of orientations_. Every ordered partition of the set {_(X, {a}_*{b}): _a_ ∈ _I(X)_ and _b_ ∈ _S(X)_ for  _X_ ∈ _HN_} is an orientation sequence. An orientation sequence (C1,...,Cm) is trivial if _m_ = 1 holds, and _elementary_ if each set _C~j~_ contains only exactly one pair.

Definition 5-4 (_immediately successful orientation sequence_):

Let _(C~1~,...,C~m~)_ be an orientation sequence, then it is inductively defined as follows: initially holds _IDP~0~_ = _IDP_. For acyclic _IDP~j-1~_ with the partitions belonging to the boxes of {_(a,b)_ : _(a^(r,i)^ , b^(r,i)^)_ ∈ _IDP~j-1~_ for _X^r^~i~_ = X} belonging to orientations _DS~j~(X)_ of _I(X) * S(X)_ holds. 

_IDP~j~_ = _ind(IDP~j-1~_ ∪ {(_a_^(_r,i_)^, b^(r,i)^): (_a,b_) ∈ _DS~j~(X)_ for (_X_, {_a_}*{_b_}) ∈ _C~j~_}). 
Thus, the orientation sequence is immediately successful if each _IDP~j~_ is acyclic for 0 ≤ _j- ≤ _m_. In this case, the projections of _IDP~m~_ onto _A(X)_, i.e. 

_DS(X)_ = {(_a,b_) :(_a_^(_r,i_)^, _b_^(_r,i_)^) ∈ _IDP~m~- for _X^r^~i~_ = X}, 

acyclic orientations of _I(X) * S(X)_, and the family of associated partitions is visit-correct.

Clearly, an EAG is an OEAG if and only if the trivial orientation order is immediately is successful. Furthermore, then every orientation order is immediately successful, and it is easy to to see that for each _DS~j~_(_X_) the box partition coincides with the box partition of _IDS(_X_). So, for each orientation order, the same visit-correct family of partitions is determined as in the OEAG procedure. In general, for any immediately successful orientation sequence, any finer orientation sequence in which each _C~j~_ is replaced by any ordered partition, is immediately successful. 

The "more careful" procedure outlined by Kastens can now be characterized by the fact that for a fixed order (X1,...,Xm) of symbols the orientation order (_C~1~,...,C~m~_) with _C~j~_ = {(_X~j~, {_a_}*{_b_}): _a_ ∈ _I(_X~j~_) and _b_ ∈ _S(_X_~j~_)} is immediately successful. This is a symbol-wise orientation order, which is uniquely determined by the order of symbols.

Definition 5-5 (_successful orientation sequence_):

Let (_C~1~,...,C~m~_) now be an elementary orientation sequence and let _IDP~j~_ and _DS~j~(_X_) be defined as before However, if _IDP~j~_ is cyclic, then instead it is defined with inverse dependencies: 

_IDP~j~_ = _ind(_IDP~j-1~_ ∪ {(_b^(r,i)^_, _a^(r,i)^_): (_a,b_) ∈ -DS~j~_(_X~j~_) for (_X^r^~i~, {_a_}*{_b_}) = _C~j~_}). 

The orientation sequence is _successful_ if again every _IDP~j~_ is acyclic for 0 ≤ _j_ ≤ _m_. 

Obviously, any elementary orientation sequence that is immediately successful is successful,and so for any OEAG, any elementary orientation sequence is successful. Since the first alternative is always acyclic, we get the same visit-correct family of partitions as for the OEAG-

// doc\soag\images\figure-5-1-one-left-to-right-threading-a-and-one-right-to-left-threading-b.PNG

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 32

Procedures. On the other hand, it is easy to see that there are EAGs with successful orientation sequences, for which no orientation sequence is already directly successful.

An EAG is a _sequentially orientable_ EAG (SOEAG) if there is a successful orientation sequence. orientation sequence exists. Thus, of course, every OEAG is a SOEAG, and every SOEAG is a multivisit EAG.

=== Two heuristic subclasses of SOEAGs.

Since the decision problem whether an EAG is a SOEAG is NP-complete, the implementation of a implementation of a SOEAG evaluator generator does not seem advisable. Instead, two useful heuristic subclasses of SOEAGs are presented, which are defined constructively, i.e., an algorithm for computing the orientation order is given and thus the subclass is defined.

Starting from the OEAG method, considerations of easy and efficient implementability hardly allow any other reasonable decision than with respect to the pursued orientation strategy in principle symbol-wise, namely in an arbitrary ad hoc order (_X~1~,...,X~k~_) of the symbols _X_∈ _HN_. To this end, the following two degrees of refinement of increasing power are conceivable:

1. the orientation order (_C~1~,...,C~m~_) with _C~j~_ = {(_X_, {_a_}*{_b_}): _a_ ∈ _I_(_X_) and _b_ ∈ _S_(_X_) for _X_ ∈ _HN_}is refined to an elementary refined one, i.e., for each symbol _X~i~_ a partition of one-element sets is formed. Each of these sets is assigned to a _C~j~_ in ascending order. The success of each orientation is immediately checked. However, in case of failures, backtracking is omitted for efficiency reasons. Only the immediate success of one ad hoc order per symbol is checked instead of all its permutations. are checked. This approach is called the (ad hoc) ESO method (ad hoc elementary symbol sequentially orienting) and approximates the first heuristic grammar subclass to be presented.

2. the same strategy is slightly more complicated to implement when checking for a successful rather than an immediately successful orientation sequence. This may require the undoing of extensions in the dependency graph of the affix parameters of a rule, which in the worst case leads to an increased effort. This procedure is called (ad hoc) ESOB procedure (ad hoc elementary symbol sequentially orienting with local backtracking) and describes by construction the second, more powerful grammar subclass.

It should be emphasized again that, given a multi-visit EAG that is not ordered, the successful generation of an evaluator depends on the ad hoc chosen orders _and_ the fineness of the procedure. If one procedure fails, then a procedure proceeding with the same order can be more finely, but also a different order can lead to the successful generation of an evaluator. In any case all procedures on OEAGen are successful.

It is easy to see that an implementation for the approximation of the second more powerful grammar subclass would also compute the grammars of the first subclass. In the revised version of <<KröpKann>>, the two grammar subclasses, as well as the two procedures describing them constructively ESO and ESOB, are no longer explicitly mentioned. Instead, only a SOAGen or SOEAGen _approximating_ procedure. I agree with this point of view and will from now on only speak of one method without referencing the two grammar subclasses mentioned.

=== Dynamic transitive envelope

The dependencies between the affix parameters of a rule induced by the affix forms are held in the data structure TDP. This data structure is also used to store the transitive closed intermediate results IDPj+ where at the j-th orientation step IDPj+ is calculated from IDPj-1+ is calculated in situ. The data structure TDP is implemented in the present evaluator generator in the module SOAG as a data element of the data structure RuleDesc in the field Rule.

For the expenditure of the approximating procedure for the generation of SOEAG evaluators is formative the algorithm used for the transitive extension of the relation TDP, whereby always only dependencies between affix parameters of the same rule. In the following, in formal notation, an efficient algorithm of Ibaraki and Katoh for the incremental transitive hulling of a monotonically growing relation is presented.  

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 33

Definition 5-6 (_incremental transitive hull_):

Let _S_ be a finite set and _R_ ∪ {(_u,v_)} ⊆ _S^2^_. Then the operators + and * are given by
            
∅^+^ = ∅,

(_R_ ∪ {(_u,v_)})+ = _R^+^_ ∪ {_x_ : _x R* u_} _×_ {_y_ : _v R* y_} and

_R*_ = _R^+^_ ∪ {(_x,x_) : _x_ ∈ _S_}.

It can be seen immediately that _R_ ∪{(_u,v_)}+ from _R+_ with the effort _O_(|_S_|^2^) can be determined. It is now, related to _R_ and (_u,v_), special predecessor and successor sets

_P~R~_(_u,v_)= {_x_ : _x R* u_, but not _x R^+^ v_} and

_S~R~_(_u,v_)={_x_ : _v R^+^ x_, but not _u R^+^ x_}

is introduced. Thus, first tightening

(_R_ ∪ {(_u,v_)})+ = _R^+^_ ∪ _P~R~_(_u,v_) × {_y_ : _v R* y_},  (1)

and Ibaraki and Katoh show in <<IbaKat>> that such is the transitive extension of the initial relation R+ by successively adding q (new) relations (_u,v_) ∈ _S^2^_ cumulatively requires only an overhead of _O_(|_S_|^3^) is required. This can even be improved to _O_(_q_⋅|_S_|), as can be shown without difficulty. The key idea is that each newly added relation requires only |_S_|- instead of |_S_|^2^ -times. Consequently, the relation _R+_, starting at ∅, can be incrementally built up in _O_(|_S_|⋅|_R^+^_|) can be constructed. 

Similarly, it is easy to show that the asymmetric algorithm (1) of Ibaraki and Katoh can be further extended to the symmetric algorithm 

(_R_ ∪ {(_u,v_)})+ = _R^+^_ ∪ _P~R~_(_u,v_) × _S~R~_(_u,v_). 

can be tightened. However, this improvement remains without consequence in the cumulative effort. 

When the inductive computational scheme is transformed into a program, where the in question relation R+ is represented by an adjacency matrix, it is to be paid attention, the determination of the successor set _S~R~_(_u,v_), which requires the overhead θ(|_S_|), to be extracted so that the enumeration of _P~R~_(_u,v_) × _S~R~_(_u,v_) does not require effort θ(|_S_|_2_) to formulate. 

The transitive extension of the relation _TDP_ is implemented in the `SOAGPartition`  module in the procedure `AddTDPTrans` implemented. In the first loop of the procedure, the list `NUV` is used to determine the successor set _S~R~_(_u,v_) is determined. The successor set can be implemented as a list, because each node is added at most once.  is added. In the second loop the enumeration of the relation _P~R~_(_u,v_) × _S~R~_(_u,v_) takes place, which forms the transitive termination in _TDP_. As required, both loops are not interleaved in order to comply with the effort described above.

=== Dynamic topological sorting

In this section, we present an algorithm that attempts to specify a successful orientation order in a single topological sort per symbol attempts to specify a successful orientation order. 

Considering _TDP_ = _IDP~k-1~^+^ then for _X_ ∈ _HN_ the projections are 

_DS_(_X_) = { (_a,b_) ∈ _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_) : (_a^(r,i)^_}, _b_^(_r,i_)^) ∈ _TDP_ for _X^r^~i~_=X}

in each case subset of an (acyclic) orientation of _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_), which makes it a complete(acyclic) orientation to be extended. (This formulation of _DS_(_X_), which in contrast to the definition of section 5.1, proves to be more convenient for the algorithm to be developed).algorithm to be developed). In principle, these extensions are made symbol-wise, which is why in the following the consideration of a fixed _X_ ∈ _HN_ suffices. As already indicated, it is proceeded in such a way that in the case of a given OEAG orientations result which are box completions of _IDS_(_X_) for _X_ ∈ _HN_. Obviously, the starting point is therefore the technique related to topological sorting. technique for determining the box completions of the above projection _DS_(_X_). We perform for the _X_ ∈ _HN_ in question, we first introduce the following symmetric relation unor ⊆ _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_), which contains the fraction of affix-pairs from _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_) that is still to be oriented:

_a unor b_ ⇔ _DS_(_X_) ∪ ({_a_} * {_b_}) = ∅.

Setting an evaluation order between two affix positions _a,b_ ∈ _A_(_X_) with _a unor b_, and this with the preference to compute _a after b_, is abstractly described as a procedure call _orient_(_a,b,X, new_) with the

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 34

output parameter _new_ is formulated. In the following sketch of the effect of a call _orient_(_a,b,X, new_) one can see the retraction of the dependency (_b, a_) in favor of (_a, b_) can be seen, if a cycle is created by (_b, a_). arises.

_TDP'_ := _TDP_;

_TDP_ := _ind_(_TDP'_ ∪ {(_b_^(_r,i_)^,_a_^(_r,i_)^): _X^r^~i~_=_X_ })^+^;

IF _TDP_ cyclic THEN

_TDP_ := _ind_(_TDP'_ ∪ {(_a_^(_r,i_)^,_b_^(_r,i_)^): _X^r^~i~_=_X_ })^+^;

IF _TDP_ cyclic THEN HALT END

END;

_new_ := {(_a,b_) ∈ _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_): (_a_^(_r,i_)^,_b_^(_r,i_)^) ∈ _TDP_ \ _TDP'_ for an _X^r^~i~_=_X_ }

After Termination obviously holds   

_new_ ∪ _DS_(_X_) = { (_a,b_) ∈ _I_(_X_) * _S_(_X_): (_a_^(_r,i_)^,_b_^(_r,i_)^) ∈ _TDP_ for an _X^r^~i~_=_X_ }.

It is clear that eventually _new_ contains not only either (_b,a_) or (_a,b_), but also possibly other new induced evaluation sequences projected onto _A_(_X_). To track _TDP_, the relation _DS_(_X_) has to be extended accordingly by these new dependencies _new_, which in turn has repercussions on the topological sorting process. on the topological sorting process of _DS_(_X_). The intended algorithm can thus be characterized as a dynamic topological sorting of the projection _DS_(_X_), interleaved with the calculation of _TDP_ and the computation of _TDP_ and the checking of cycles.

To derive the algorithm, a key intermediate result is described below: Let j ≥ 0 such that the computation of the quantities ∅ = _B~0~_(_X_) ⊆ _B~1~_(_X_) ⊆ ... ⊆ _B~2n(X)~_(_X_)=_A_(_X_) has already been completed up to and including -B~j~_(_X_), since these sets initially have the properties

_B~0~_(_X-) = ∅,

_B~1~_(_X_) = { _a_ ∈ _S_(_X_): there is no (_a,b_) ∈ _DS_(_X_)} 

and for _i_ < _j_

_B~i+1~_(_X_) = { _a_: for all (_a,b_) ∈ _DS_(_X_) holds _b_ ∈ _B~i~_(_X_) }

and since, moreover, because of the validity of

{_b_: _a unor b_} = ∅ for all _a_ ∈ _B~j~_(_X_) (2)

acyclic expansions of _DS_(_X_) remain without influence on the validity of these invariants. The set variable

_cur- = { _a_ ∈ _A_(_X_) \ _B~i~_(_X_): for all (_a,b_) ∈ _DS_(_X_) _b_ ∈ _B~j~_(_X_) holds } (3)

contains candidates for affixes new in _B~j+1~_(_X_) with respect to _B~j~_(_X_). (The computation of the sets _B~i~_(_X_) and also of _n_(_X_) is done only implicitly). Obviously now the validity of 

{_b_: _a unor b_} = ∅ for all _a_ ∈ _cur_

and consequently

{_b_: _a unor b_} = ∅ for all _a_ ∈ _B~j+1~_(_X_) (4)

in that for each affix position _a_ ∈ _cur_, for which evaluation sequences with respect to
affix positions _b_ are unknown, these are now determined, whereby in each case the order to evaluate _a after b_ is preferred.

Therefore, if we consider at this point (_a,b_) with _a_ ∈ _cur_ and _a unor b_ and extend _TDP_ by means of a call _orient_(_a,b,X, new_), then one has to investigate how the given invariants can be obtained if now _DS_(_X_) is successively extended by the new relations (_c,d_) ∈ _new_. Along with the statement

_DS_(_X_) := _DS_(_X_) ∪ {(_c,d_)}

goes first the correction of the relation unor according to the definition by

_unor_ := _unor_ \ ({_c_}*{_d_}).

Now, because of (2), it is clear that _DS_(_X_) restricted to attributes from _B~j~_(_X_) ∪ _cur_ is already an orientation, and (_c,d_) furthermore extends _DS_(_X_) acyclically. Therefore, it follows immediately that _c,d_ ∉ _B~j~_(_X_) and |{_c,d_} ∪ _cur_ | ≤ 1 holds. The invariant (3), violated only in the case _c_ ∈ _cur_, thus requires to remove _c_ from _cur_.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 35

When extending _DS_(_X_) by all new dependencies (_c,d_) ∈ _new_, either (_b,a_) or (_a,b_) is included in _DS_(_X_) so that in any case _a unor b_ is no longer valid; if (_a,b_) was included, then even a ∉_B~j+1~_(_X_). Thus, after treating all _a, b_ with _a unor b_, _cur_ = _B~j+1~_(_X_) \ _B~j~_(_X_), and it is true that in fact (4). 

Now _j_ is (implicitly) increased and again (3) is ensured. This is done by a statement 

_cur_ := _leaves_ 

where the new quantities are defined as follows: 

_leaves_ = { _a_ ∈ _A_(_X_) \ (_B~j~_(_X_) ∪ _cur_): _deg_(_a_)=0 }, 

_deg_(_a_)=|_DS_(_X_)(_a_) \ _B~j~_(_X_)| for all _a_ ∈ _A_(_X_). 

How _deg_ and _leaves_ can be efficiently carried along is described in more detail in Section 5.6 "Implementation Details". in more detail.

=== Implementation details

At the beginning of every partition determination, all direct dependencies between the affix parameters of a rule _r_ must be entered in the dependency graph `SOAG.Rule[_r_]`. `TDP` this is done for all rules by the procedure `ComputeDP`. If an affix is used in the affix form of an applying affix parameter, the affix depends directly on the defining affix parameter, which contains the defining affix of the same name. Before determining the dependencies in a rule context, each affix occurring in the rule must be assigned to the affix parameter in whose affix form it occurs. must be assigned to each normally occurring affix. This assignment is done by the procedure `SetAffOccforVars` in the module-global field `VarBuf`, which contains the following data structure for each affix of a rule

----
TYPE
    VarBufDesc = RECORD
        AffOcc, Sym,
        Num, VarInd: INTEGER
    END;
    OpenVarBuf = POINTER TO ARRAY OF VarBufDesc;

VAR
    VarBuf: OpenVarBuf;
    NextVarBuf: INTEGER;
----

The `VarBuf` field is cleared and reused for each rule, since the information it contains will not be needed later. is no longer needed.

For explaining the dependencies of an applying affix parameter, for each affix it contains the affix parameter of its defining affix must be known. The procedure `ComputeDefAffOcc` calculates for each affix variable of the current rule in the `SOAG.DefAffOcc` field, which is parallel to `EAG.Var`, the Affix parameter in which the defining affix of the affix variable is located. This is done by linear search in the `VarBuf` field. If no defining affix is found, a violation of the link-definiteness condition is present; an error message and the position of the undefined affix are output and the program is aborted.

The procedure `ComputeAffixApplCnt` calculates for all affix variables the number of their applications in syntheses and comparisons. For this purpose the field `VarBuf` is searched linearly and for non-defining affixes and affixes in applying affix parameters, the value in the `AffixApplCnt` field is incremented accordingly. Additionally, for all comparisons to be performed in a rule r, edges are added to the data structure `SOAG.Rule[_r_]`. `DP`. These dependencies are not really present, but refer from affix parameters with defining affixes to affix parameters with affixes of the same name or affixes with the same name negated by "_#_". This additional information is used later in the optimization of the storage of affix variables. Before applying the procedure `ComputeAffixApplCnt` procedure, the `SOAG.DefAffOcc` data structure for the current rule must have been completely calculated for the current rule.

After calculating the `SOAG.DefAffOcc` field, all direct dependencies are added to the dependency structure using the procedure `AddTDPTrans` into the dependency graph and the transitive completion is formed. All dependencies determined by `AddTDPTrans` are additionally stored by entry into the cellar memory

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 36

`MarkedEdges` marked. In parallel to the calculation of _TDP_, all direct dependencies of a rule _r_ are dependencies of a rule _r_ are entered into the data structure `SOAG.Rule[_r_]`. `DP`.

In the procedure `ComputeInducedTDP` all marked edges are successively removed from the cellar memory `MarkedEdges`. For each marked edge all transitive dependencies are computed and added to the dependency graph if they were not already included. All newly entered edges will be marked by adding them to the basement memory `MarkedEdges`. This procedure is repeated until the basement memory is empty. The termination of the loop is guaranteed by the finiteness of the transitive hull of a dependency graph.

The procedure `orient` implements the abstract procedure _orient_ introduced in Section 5.5 "Dynamic topological sorting". abstract procedure orient. If the orientation of two affix positions in _TDP_ results in a cycle, then all previous extensions of _TDP_ must be undone before inserting the reverse dependency. must be undone before inserting the reverse dependency. For this the module-global variable ´`phase` must be set to `dynTopSort`. If this is the case, then during the transitive completion in AddTDPTrans by the procedure `AddTDPChange` in the ´ChangeBuf` field with the structure

----
TYPE
ChangeBufDesc = RECORD
RuleInd,
AffOccInd1,
AffOccInd2: INTEGER;
END;
OpenChangeBuf: POINTER TO ARRAY OF ChangeBufDesc;
VAR
ChangeBuf: OpenChangeBuf;
NextChangeBuf: INTEGER;
----

all changes of the _TDP_ are recorded. These extensions can then be undone by the procedure `ResetTDPChanges` procedure. The set new returned by _orient_ is implemented in the variable `New` as a set of type `BSets`. Each entry in this set results in a pair of affix items:

`_first element_ = _set entry DIV Separator_`

`_second element_ = _set entry MOD separator_`

The `separator` is calculated in the procedure `DynTopSort`. 

The procedure `DynTopSortSym` implements the procedure for topological sorting motivated in section 5.5 "Dynamic topological sorting". for the topological sorting of the affix position dependencies of a symbol under the following conditions approaching a successful or immediately successful orientation. The algorithm starts with the initialization of the data structure `DS`.
----
TYPE
    DS: POINTER TO ARRAY OF INTEGER;
----
It realizes for a symbol _X_ the set of acyclic orientations _DS_(_X_). Furthermore, since _DS_(_X_) ∩ _unor_ holds, the relation _unor_ is additionally integrated in the data structure `DS`. Since the orientations for all symbols independently and successively, the data structure `DS` can be reused for each symbol. can be reused for each symbol. For an entry in the field `DS` thus applies
----
DS[a][b] = element ⇔ (a, b) ∈ _DS_(_X_)
DS[a][b] = nil ⇒ (a, b) ∉ _DS_(_X_)
DS[a][b] = unor ⇔ a _unor_ b
----
During the computation of the relation _unor_, the field `Deg` is filled simultaneously, which contains for each affix positionc of the current symbol.

Then, the two sets cur and leave are initialized, which are `cur` and `leave` from Section 5.5 "Dynamic topological sorting". Both sets are of type `ASets` in order to be able to delete elements with a constant effort.

The actual topological sorting process is controlled by a REPEAT loop, which is executed until all is executed until all affix positions of the current symbol are assigned to a partition set. This condition occurs when the set `Cur` is empty, which corresponds to the termination condition of the loop. By

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 37

the use of a REPEAT loop, the loop is run at least once, even if `Cur` is empty after initialization. After initialization `Cur` can be empty exactly if there are no synthesized- but only inherited- values in the partition _A~n(X)_~(_X_) of a symbol _X_ there are no synthesized but only inherited affix positions, i.e. _B~1~_(_X_) is empty.

The partition sets computed in the implementation do not correspond completely to the theoretically produced reasons, the partition sets calculated in the implementation do not quite correspond to the theoretically derived ones. For the partition sets calculated in the implementation partition sets _A^I^~j~_(_X_) holds:

_A^I^~j~_(_X_) = _B~j~_(_X_) \ _B~j-1~_(_X_),

and the derived partition sets then result from

_A~i~_(_X_) = _A^I^~_2(n(X)-i+1)_~(_X_) ∪ _A^I^_~_2(n(X)-i)+1_~(X) with

_A^I^~_2(n(X)-i+1)_~(_X_) = _A~i~_(_X_) ∩ _I_(_X_) and

_A^I^~_2(n(X)-i+1)_~(_X_) = _A~i~_(_X_) ∩ _S_(_X_).

Thus, the computed partition sets alternately contain only inherited or synthesized affixes.However, this does not further limit the implemented algorithm, since the sought partition sets, can be derived very easily, as stated above. In the following the partition sets are always the implementation-related partition sets are meant as partition sets. 

In each loop pass in `Cur` implicitly exactly one partition set of the searched affix partition is calculated. All elements of the set `Cur` are potential candidates for this set. Since the affix positions in the set `Cur` are to be examined in an arbitrary, but fixed order, they are computed before the second loop, which contains the orientation call `Orient`, they are transferred to the list `LastCur`. The order of the elements is fixed. This is necessary, since due to the implementation of the set type `ASets`, changes in the sequence can result from deleting elements.

After the orientation of all affix positions in `Cur` resp. the affix positions in _unor_ relation to them, the partition affix positions, the partition number `Part` is incremented by one. All affix positions remaining in the set `Cur` affix positions now belong to a partition set. Each of these affix positions _n_ ∈ `Cur` is stored in the `SOAG.PartNum[_n_]` data structure is assigned the current partition number. All incoming edges that refer to these affix positions are deleted in the `Deg` field by decrementing. If there are no affix positions for one of the affix positions, which originally referred to affix positions from `Cur`, there are no more outgoing edges, so it is included in the `Leave` set.

At the end of the REPEAT loop, `Cur` results from `Leave`, `Leave` is emptied, and the sorting process continues with the calculation of the next partition set until `Cur` is empty.

The membership of an affix position to a partition set is modeled by the partition number in the field `SOAG.PartNum`. After completion of the topological sorting process all affix positions of a partition set of a partition set have the same partition number.

=== Calculation of the visit sequences

This chapter describes how to construct the visit sequences for the evaluator rules of a SOAG.
are constructed.

=== Visit sequences

For each node _k_ of a derivation tree to which the rule _r_ has been applied, the visit sequence _VS~r~_ represents a local traversal rule. It describes the order in which the sons of node _k_ have to be visited and when to ascend to the parent node. Implicit in the visit sequences is the order in which the affix parameters are evaluated, because before each visit of a node, the instances of applying affix parameters needed during the visit must be synthesized. must be synthesized. After the visit, newly calculated instances of defining affix parameters must be must be analyzed. All instances of defining affix parameters of a node _k_ are computed in the upper context of _k_, those of its sons in the lower context of the respective son. From the point of view of node _k_, for the compute these instances, there must be an ascent to the father node or a visit to the son. The instances of defining affix parameters of predicates are computed by calling the predicate. Therefore, the content of visit sequences results in three types of _instructions_:

1. _VISIT_(_X~i~^r^, n_) indicates the _n_-th visit of the symbol occurrence _X~i~_ in rule _r_,
2. _LEAVE_(_n_) indicates the _n_-th ascent to the parent node,
3. _CALL_(_X_) indicates the invocation of a predicate _X_.

To map affix parameters to instructions, the _MAP_VS_ function is defined.

MAP_VS(a(r,i)) :=

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|VISIT(Xir, n)
|if a(r,i) ∈ APD(r), i>0 and a(r,i) ∈ An(X) with X= Xir and X ist a basic nonterminal; or

|LEAVE(n)
|if a(r,i) ∈ APD(r), i=0 and a(r,i) ∈ An(X) with X= Xir and X ist a basic nonterminal; or
b
|CALL(X)
|if a(r,i) ∈ APD(r), i>0 and with X=Xir is X a pridcate nonterminal; or

|NOP
|else (no instruction).
|=== 

The partition (_A~1~_(_X_),...,_A~n(X)_~(_X_)) found for the affix positions of a symbol _X_ shows the order in which the affix positions must be calculated. order the affix positions have to be calculated. If a partition set _A~i~_(_X_) contains more than one affix positions, their order of calculation can be chosen arbitrarily. In the dependency graphs of the rules with symbol occurrences of _X_, additional dependencies between the affix parameters of the symbol occurrence _X_ are entered in such a way that the calculation sequence is thereby manifested. The application of the function _MAP_VS_ to the topologically sorted affix parameters of a rule yields a list of instructions.  of instructions. After adding some final instructions and eliminating duplicate instructions from this list, the result is instructions from this list, the visit sequence of a rule results. 

The visit sequence of an evaluator rule r is constructed as follows: Let _a~1~_^(_r_)^..._a~k~_^(_r_)^ be a topological sorting of the graph (_AP_~(_r_)~,_IDP~m~_(_r_)) with _k_=|_AP_(_r_)| to a orientation sequence (_C~1~_,...,_C~m~_), then the visit sequence _VS~r~_ arises from the sequence

_MAP_VS_(_a~1~_^(_r_)^)... _MAP_VS_(_a~k~_^(_r_)^) _INSTR_(_X~i~^r^_)..._INSTR_(_X^r^~#S(r_)~) _INSTR_(_X~0~^r^_),

where duplicate instructions are deleted.

Definition 6-2 (INSTR):
VISIT(Xi

) := LEAVE(n(X)), if i=0 and Xi
r
=X is a basic non-terminal; or
CALL(X), if i>0 and Xi
r
=X is a predicate nonterminal; or
NOP, else.

The final instructions ensure that the traversal of the derivation tree is complete and that all affix parameters are calculated. and that all affix parameters are calculated. 

Each visit sequence _VS~r~_ can be divided into _n_(_X_) parts _VS~r~^1^_, ...,_VS~r~^n(X)_^ where _X_=_X~0~^r^_ holds. Each _VS~r~^i^_ ends with _LEAVE_(_i_) and is called a _plan_.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 46

=== Implementation details

The procedure `ComputeVisitNo` calculates the visit number for each affix position from its affiliation to a partition set whose index is stored in the data structure `SOAG.PartNum`. Since the partition sets are available in reverse order, the following formula results for the calculation of the visit number the following formula 

(_MaxPart_ + 1) DIV 2 - (_PartNum_ + 1) DIV 2 + 1

`MaxPart` is the maximum index of a partition set of a symbol. The calculated visit number is again in the data structure `SOAG.PartNum`, since its content is no longer needed. Since the name and content of the data structure no longer match after the calculation of the visit numbers, the functions `GetVisitNo` and `GetMaxVisitNo` have been defined as interface functions for accessing the `SOAG.PartNum`. The first returns the visit number of an affix parameter, the second the maximum visit number of a symbol occurrence. visit number of a symbol occurrence. Both functions are exported.

The functions `MapVS` and `CompleteTraversal` implement the functions `MAP_VS` and `INV_VS` described in section 6.1 "Visit sequences". `MAP_VS` and _INSTR_ respectively. Both functions return instructions of the type `instruction`, which are defined in the `SOAG`  module.

The function `TopSort` implements the topological sorting of all affix parameters of a rule. It uses The iterative algorithm of K.Mehlhorn is used, as it is described in <<Mehlhorn>>. The two global variables

----
VAR
    InDeg: SOAG.OpenInteger;
    ZeroInDeg: Stacks.Stack;
----

are used to store intermediate results and to control the topological sorting process. `InDeg` contains the number of incoming edges for all affix parameters of the current rule. `ZeroInDeg` contains all affix parameters that have no incoming edges. After initialisation `ZeroInDeg` contains all affix parameters that must be evaluated first. These are removed one after the other from the set `ZeroInDeg` and transferred into the visit sequence using the `MapVS` function. For transferred, the edges that go out from them and go into other affix parameters are deleted for all transferred affix parameters by decrementing the field `InDeg` of the corresponding affix parameter. is decremented. If such an affix parameter also has no more incoming edges, i.e. if the field `InDeg` is zero, it is transferred to the set `ZeroInDeg`, which is implemented as a stack. This is continued until `ZeroInDeg` is empty. The calculated visit sequences for each rule are one after the other in the field `VS` of the module `SOAG`. The beginning and end of the visit sequence of a rule R are contained in the substructure `VS` of the type `EAG.ScopeDesc` of the field element `Rule[R]` in the same module contained. 

In order to retrieve a visit instruction, the functions `GetVisit` and `GetNextVisit` have been defined. They each return the number of the passed visit instruction from the `SOAG.VS` list of a rule and are also exported. rule and are also exported.

=== Hash Table for Elimination of Duplicate Instructions

In order to eliminate duplicate instructions in the visit sequence of an evaluator rule, all instructions are  are additionally entered into a hash table. Before a new instruction is entered into the visit sequence, it is it is checked whether the instruction is already contained in the hash table. If this is the case, the current instruction is discarded, thus avoiding duplicate instruction occurrences.

To determine the access addresses in the hash table, the double hashing procedure was implemented. (double hashing) has been implemented. This involves the use of two hash functions _f_ and _g_ and the following rule for the calculation of a fallback address in case of collision for an element _i_ and a table of the length _m_:

_a~j~_(_i_) = (_f_(_i_) - (_j-1_)*_g_(_i_)) _mod m_

The length of the table is calculated with _m_=_2^k^_ and _k_=_1+log~2~max_{|_AP_(_r_)|: _r_ is evaluator rule} is always fixed to a multiple of 2 and the function _g_ with

_g_ = (_f_(_i_) _div_ 2) * 2 + 1

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Page 47

always maps to odd numbers. This ensures that the list of alternate addresses is really a permutation. addresses is really a permutation, i.e. the alternate addresses are not repeated. 

With a table load of less than 50%, which is always the case with the above table size, the average collision depths to be expected with equally distributed _f_(i) are, according to <<COMA>> p.90, less than 1.5. The implemented function _f_ does not produce absolutely equally distributed values, but it is sufficient for the required purpose. purpose, so that the average collision depths to be expected are unlikely to be greater than 1.5. 

=== Implementations

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Optimisation of affix variable storage

During the evaluation of a decorated derivation tree of an EAG, the instances of all affix positions are computed one after the other in the form of their affix variables and must be available in the memory, as the syntheses of other affix positions can refer to them. The storage of the affix position instances takes up a lot of space, and efforts are therefore being made to find an optimisation for this. 

In the following, the approach of Engelfriet and de Jong is presented. In [EngJong] they present a polynomial algorithm that decides for multi-visit AGs whether an attribute can be implemented as a basement store. can be implemented. Transferring this approach to EAGs does not pose any problems, as was the case with the SOAG method. In addition, a variant of the algorithm can determine whether in a can only contain one value in a basement memory of an affix position and therefore the use of a global variable is indicated.

The optimisation conditions presented in <<EngJong>> refer to affix positions of symbols. The data structure concept of the generated compilers, which will be presented in the following chapter, uses global variables for affix positions anyway. global variables (or a global field of variables) for affix positions anyway. Central object of semantic calculations are the affix variables of each rule. However, as is easily can be easily seen, each affix variable has the same optimisation properties as the affix position to which the affix parameter in which the affix is defined. For this reason, the properties calculated for this reason, the properties calculated for affix positions can be used to optimise affix variable storage.

A further refinement of the approach presented here with regard to the affix variables of each rule is conceivable. In doing so, one could assume that the affix variables of a rule possess optimisation properties, independent of the affix variables of other rules, whereas in the approach to be presented an in one rule affects the optimisation properties of the affix variables of all other rules with the same symbol occurrence. rules with the same symbol occurrence. This possibility of refinement will not be further investigated further.

=== Optimisation through basement storage

One possibility for optimisation is to use cellar storage for affix positions that meet certain conditions, cellar storage for affix positions that meet certain conditions, a separate cellar storage for each affix position. An instance of such an affix position would be placed in the basement memory after it has been calculated, and after the calculation of the instance that depends on it, it would be removed from there. In this way, the value of the instance is only the shortest possible period of time.

First, each plan _VS~r~^i^_ of the visit sequence of a rule _r_ 

_VS~r~^i^_ = _VISIT_(_X~1~, j~1~_) ... _VISIT_(_X~k~, j~k~_) _LEAVE_(_i_)

to calculate the sets of inheritedAffixpositions before and after each visit (CALL's are abstracted here) _AI~l~(_X_) = {_a~k~^(r,j)^_ : a~k~^X^ ∈ _A~l~_(_X)_ ∩ _I_(_X_) with _X_ = _X~j~^r^_ } and synthesised affix positions _ASl_(_X_) = {_a~k~^(r,j)^_ : a~k~^X^ ∈ _A~l~_(_X)_ ∩ _S_(_X_) with _X_ = _X~j~^r^_ } extended:

_EVS~r~^i^_ = _AI~i~_(_Y~0~r^^_) _AI~j1~_(_X~1~_) _VISIT_(_X~1~, j~1~_) _AS~j1~_(_X~1~_) ... AIjk(Xk) VISIT(Xk, jk) ASjk(Xk) ASi(Y0r) LEAVE(i)

The plans EVS~r~^i^_ become an extended visit sequence 

_EVS~r~_ = _EVS~r~^0^ EVS~r~^n(X)_^ with _X_ = _X~0~^r^_ 

summarised. Note that each affix parameter ak(r,j) of the rule r is an element of exactly one set in EVSr which is defined by setr(ak(r,j)) uniquely. For two elements u and v of the extended visit sequence EVSr, a relation "<" is now defined so that u<v applies if u precedes v in the sequence EVSr. Analogously the relation "≤" is defined.
